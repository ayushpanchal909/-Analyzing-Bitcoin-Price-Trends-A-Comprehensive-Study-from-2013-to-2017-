## Bitcoin-Analysis

In this project, I gathered a dataset related to Bitcoin from a CSV file. Once the data collection was complete, I carried out essential data cleaning steps, which involved managing duplicated entries and dealing with empty values. Following the cleaning process, I conducted data pre-processing and extracted valuable statistical insights from the dataset.

The primary goal of this analysis was to assess the performance of Bitcoin between 2013 and 2017 using various parameters such as open, close, high, and low values recorded each day. I performed an in-depth examination of these aspects, utilizing candlestick graphs to visualize historical price trends. Additionally, I generated line charts to analyze the closing price both on a standard scale and a logarithmic scale.

To provide a comprehensive view, I further created line charts that depicted the closing price trends on a yearly, quarterly, and monthly basis. This approach enabled the identification of significant patterns and fluctuations in Bitcoin's closing price over different time periods.

In summary, this project involved collecting and cleaning a Bitcoin dataset from a CSV file. The subsequent steps encompassed data pre-processing and the extraction of statistical insights. The analysis aimed to comprehend Bitcoin's performance using open, close, high, and low values, supported by candlestick and line graphs. The examination of closing prices on various scales and timeframes provided valuable insights into the cryptocurrency's behavior from 2013 to 2017.

### Objective of Analysis
>How did the open, close, high, and low values of Bitcoin fluctuate over the months in the given time period?

>Could you describe the significant price patterns and trends in the historical Bitcoin candlestick chart over the given timeframe?

>How does the comparison between the line chart with normal scaling and the one with log scaling for Bitcoin's closing value reveal insights into its price growth and volatility?

>What are the discernible patterns and differences in Bitcoin's closing value trends when comparing its performance on a yearly, quarterly, and monthly basis through the provided line charts?

The line graphs depicting Bitcoin's price data, one in normal scaling and the other in log scaling, offer distinct insights. In the normal scaling graph, the price fluctuations are visually pronounced, showcasing the rapid shifts in values. Conversely, the log scaling graph compresses the vertical axis, highlighting the relative percentage changes over time. This perspective accentuates the significant growth and periodic spikes in the cryptocurrency's value. Both graphs collectively portray the dynamic nature of Bitcoin's market, with the log scale emphasizing the relative magnitude of price movements over the examined period.
