## Bitcoin-Analysis

In this project, I gathered a dataset related to Bitcoin from a CSV file. Once the data collection was complete, I carried out essential data cleaning steps, which involved managing duplicated entries and dealing with empty values. Following the cleaning process, I conducted data pre-processing and extracted valuable statistical insights from the dataset.

The primary goal of this analysis was to assess the performance of Bitcoin between 2013 and 2017 using various parameters such as open, close, high, and low values recorded each day. I performed an in-depth examination of these aspects, utilizing candlestick graphs to visualize historical price trends. Additionally, I generated line charts to analyze the closing price both on a standard scale and a logarithmic scale.

To provide a comprehensive view, I further created line charts that depicted the closing price trends on a yearly, quarterly, and monthly basis. This approach enabled the identification of significant patterns and fluctuations in Bitcoin's closing price over different time periods.

In summary, this project involved collecting and cleaning a Bitcoin dataset from a CSV file. The subsequent steps encompassed data pre-processing and the extraction of statistical insights. The analysis aimed to comprehend Bitcoin's performance using open, close, high, and low values, supported by candlestick and line graphs. The examination of closing prices on various scales and timeframes provided valuable insights into the cryptocurrency's behavior from 2013 to 2017.
